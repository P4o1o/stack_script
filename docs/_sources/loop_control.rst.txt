**if**
~~~~~~

The `if` statement in stack-based programming works as follows:

.. code-block:: text

    expression or boolean value
    [quoted instruction to execute if condition true]
    [quoted instruction to execute if condition false]
    if


This statement pops two quoted instructions and a boolean value or expression from the stack. If the value is `true`, it executes the first instruction. Otherwise, it executes the second instruction.

Example:

Suppose we have the following instructions on the stack:

.. code-block:: text

    true [5 6 *] [3 2 *] if

After executing this `if` statement, the result will be:

.. code-block:: text

    30

Because `true` is on the stack, it executes the second quoted instruction in the stack  `[5 6 *]`, which multiplies 5 and 6, resulting in 30.

If the boolean value is `false`, it executes the first quoted instruction.

**nop**
~~~~~~~

The `nop` operation simply does nothing. It can be useful as a placeholder or for alignment purposes.

Example:

Suppose we have the following instructions on the stack:

.. code-block:: text

    empty [nop] [ 6 *] if

After executing this `if` statement, the program will do nothing.

Assuming the stack was empty before executing the code, `false` will be on the top of the stack, so if will execute the second quoted instruction `[nop]` preventing the program from a stack underflow.

The `nop` operation has no effect on the stack.

Example:

Suppose we have the following instructions on the stack:

.. code-block:: text

    5 3 + nop

After executing the `nop` operation, the stack remains unchanged:

.. code-block:: text

    8
