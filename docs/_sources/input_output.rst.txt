Input/Output
------------

**print**
~~~~~~~~~

The `print` operation prints the first value of the stack to be popped without removing it.

Example:

Suppose we have the following instructions on the stack:

.. code-block:: text

    42 print

After executing the `print` operation, the value 42 will be printed to the output.

**printall**
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `printall` operation prints all values on the stack without removing them. It prints the values from top to bottom.

Example:

Suppose we have the following instructions on the stack:

.. code-block:: text

    1 2 3 printall

After executing the `printall` operation, the values 1, 2, and 3 will be printed to the output, each separated by a new line.

**save[]**
The `save` instruction saves the whole content of the stack in the specified file (in appending mode)

Example:

.. code-block:: text

    10 32 3 2 4 3  save(examples/example0.sksp)


**load[]**
The `save` instruction read the content of the specified file and execute its content


Example:

.. code-block:: text

    load(examples/example0.sksp) => 10 32 3 2 4 3

    load(examples/example1.sksp)
    mean => 9
