String Operations
================

Strings are textual values enclosed in double quotes, for example: "hello world". They are a fundamental data type and can be manipulated with various language operations.

**Creating strings**
-------------------

To create a string, simply write it between double quotes:

.. code-block:: text

    "hello world"
    "123"
    "foo bar baz"

**String operations**
--------------------

- Strings can be printed with `print` or `printall`.
- They can be compared using comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, etc.).
- They can be concatenated using `compose` (see below).
- They can be split into parts with `split`.
- They can be compressed into a single string with `compress`.

**split**
~~~~~~~~~

The `split` operation divides a string into substrings separated by spaces (or by a specific delimiter with `split(delim)`). Each substring is pushed onto the stack as a new string.

Example:

.. code-block:: text

    "hello world stack" split => "hello" "world" "stack"
    "a,b,c" "," split => "a" "b" "c"

**compress**
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `compress` operation transforms a sequence of strings on the stack into a single concatenated string, separating values with a space.

Example:

.. code-block:: text

    "hello" "world" compress => "hello world"

**compose**
~~~~~~~~~~~

The `compose` operation can also be used with strings to concatenate them:

.. code-block:: text

    "foo" "bar" compose => "foobar"

**Other examples**
------------------

.. code-block:: text

    "one two three" split => "one" "two" "three"
    "a-b-c" "-" split => "a" "b" "c"
    "a" "b" "c" compress => "a b c"
    "a" "b" compose => "ab"

**Note**: Strings can also be used as arguments for other operations, such as `save`, `load`, or as keys for user-defined instructions.
