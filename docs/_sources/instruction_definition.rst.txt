Instruction Definition
----------------------

**define**
~~~~~~~~~~

The `define` operation allows you to define composite instructions by grouping multiple instructions under a single name.

Syntax:

.. code-block:: text

    [instructions] define(instruction_name)

This syntax defines an instruction named `instruction_name` consisting of the instructions enclosed in square brackets.

Example:

Suppose we want to define an instruction named "add_and_double" that adds two numbers and then doubles the result:

.. code-block:: text

    [+ dup *] define(add_and_double)

When calling `add_and_double`, it will execute the instructions `[+ dup *]` as a single unit.

.. code-block:: text

    3 4 add_and_double => 49


**delete**
~~~~~~~~~~

The `delete` operation allows you to forget a previously defined instruction.

Syntax:

.. code-block:: text

    delete(instruction_name)

This syntax deletes the instruction named `instruction_name` from the list of defined instructions.

Example:

Suppose we want to delete the previously defined instruction "add_and_double":

.. code-block:: text

    delete(add_and_double)

After executing this operation, the "add_and_double" instruction will no longer be available for use.

**isdef**
~~~~~~~~~

The `isdef` operation checks if a particular instruction is defined and returns a boolean value.

Syntax:

.. code-block:: text

    isdef(instruction_name)

This syntax returns `true` if the instruction named `instruction_name` is defined, otherwise it returns `false`.

Example:

Suppose we want to check if the instruction "add_and_double" is defined:

.. code-block:: text

    isdef(add_and_double)

This will return `true` if "add_and_double" is defined, and `false` otherwise.
